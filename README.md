# LAB4_EMBEDDED

This github shows changes to the respective code that was already given to us. Q1 regards the LED. We were able to change the timer from 1000ms to the asked time of 250ms. This means that every 250ms the LED would blink

As for the second part of the lab we were asked to create a PWM with a 10% duty cycle and a period of 500ms. This was done with the modifications seen in the code Q2.

Lastly we were able to create another PWM but this time with a period of 250ms and a 20% duty cycle.
